# Kubernetes Review

Kubernetes is kind of similar to `docker-compose`.

- You build docker images and Kubernetes lets you manage those images (i.e. names, metadata, who can access what, ports, resources allocated, etc.)

However, it's a bit different in that we need to allocate resources in a cluster and Kubernetes manages all of those images within that cluster.
